# Hello World

The point of this assignment is to go through the process of
writing, compiling, and submitting a simple C++ program as
a homework assignment. The implementation is quite trivial;
the difficulty will be in going through the process, which is
new to all of you. (And us!)

## What To Do

There are two steps to doing this homework. 

1. Get your environment set up so you can get, edit, and build the
   source code, and be able to run (execute) the program that you've
   built.

2. Implement a super simple function and submit your `hello.cpp` file
   for grading.

## Setting Up Your Environment



In the file `hello.cpp`, implement the `say_hello_world` so it says
"Hello World!" (or whatever you'd like). Then make the project and run
your executable.
